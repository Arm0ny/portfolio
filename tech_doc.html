          <p>Python is an interpreted programming language invented in 1991
          by Guido van Rossum, it's high level sintax makes it incredibly easy to learn
          and it's versatility makes it the perfect choice for several applications
          and topics.
          In this guide we will show how easy it is to get started with python and
          introduce you to the basic concepts of this incredibly powerfull language</p>

          <h2>Download and Install</h2>
          <p>In order to download and install Python on your system you have to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download Python</a>page</li>
            <li>Click on the Yellow Button that says "Download Python" in the top-left of the page<br>
            <i>Note: this may Change in Future but the concept should remain the same</i></li>
            <li>Unpack the downloaded file if necessary</li>
            <li>Double click on the .exe/.dmg depending on your system and follow the instruction
            provided by the setub wizard in order to install Python correctly</li>
          </ol>
          <p>At this point you should have installed the Python IDE application that we will use
          later to start programming in Python</p>

        <header>Variables</header>
        <p>The first and most important aspect of every programming language
        is certainly <b>Variables</b>, those are the foundamental instrument to read
        and store data that you'll need in future in your program.
        For example:</p>

      <code>a = 26</code>

        <p>means that in the variable called a it is stored the value of 26</p>
        <p>infact if you type:</p>

        <code>print(a)<br>
        output: 26</code>

        <p><i>Note: the 'print' command is used to display data to the console</i>
        as you can see the output of the print instuction passing the name of the Variable
        is the value stored in it</p>

        <em>important: Variables name can start whith letters and special cases but not
        with a number</em>

        <header>Operators</header>
        <article class="article">
          <p>What we learned so far is important but not enough to make actual
          operations with our program, to reach that goal, we first need to learn about
          <b>Operators</b>.<br>
          These are no other then what you expect from their name: symbols to let the
          program know what operation to perform.
          for example, if we write:</p>

          <code>print(26+3)<br>
          Output: 29</code>

          <p>Or:</p>

          <code>print(26-3)<br>
          Output: 23</code>
          <p>And so on</p>

          <p>a complete list of the Python operators could be found at
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_operators.asp">
          This Link</a></p>

          <p>Now that we know ho to use Operators and Variables we can combine
          them toghether to obtain awesome results.
          For example:</p>

          <code>a = 26<br>
          b = 10<br>
          print(a+b)</code>
          <code>Output: 36</code>

        <header>Conditions</header>
        <article class="article">
          <p>Now that we know well how to use operators to perform operations
          we can talk about <b>Conditional Statements</b>, these are special functions
          provided by every programming language that are used to perform an application
          <b>Only if a certain Condition is  met.</b>
          The principal "building blocks" of a condition in python are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>if</li>
            <li>else</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Let's see them in action with an example: <br>
          let's assume that you want to check if a certain number a is grater
          than another number b and if this is true, you whant to display a message
          which says that a is grater than b, if not you want to display the opposit
          in this case we can do as it follows: </p>

          <code>a = 26<br>
          b = 10<br>
          if a > b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is grater than b")</p>
          else:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is not grater than b")</p></code>
          <code>Output: a is grater than b </code>

          <p>The if statement takes care only of the condition expressed after it's called
          while the else statement does something in all the other cases, infact, in our example,
          the if statement checks only if a in grater than b and the else statement is "activated"
          in all the other cases (a < b or a = b).</p>

          <p>to express more than one condition we can use the <b>elif</b> statement.
          For example:</p>

          <code>a = 26<br>
          b = 10<br>
          if a > b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is grater than b")</p>
          elif a < b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is less than b")</p>
          else:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a and b are equal")</p></code>
          <code>Output: a is grater than b </code>

          <p>with a < b:</p>

          <code>a = 6<br>
          b = 10<br>
          if a > b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is grater than b")</p>
          elif a < b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is less than b")</p>
          else:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a and b are equal")</p></code>
          <code>Output: a is less than b </code>

          <p>with a = b:</p>

          <code>a = 10<br>
          b = 10<br>
          if a > b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is grater than b")</p>
          elif a < b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a is less than b")</p>
          else:<br>
          <p class="indent">print("a and b are equal")</p></code>
          <code>Output: a and b are equal </code>

          <p>Remember that the little space befor the print lines is called <b>indentation</b>
          and it's a way to let the program know that the line itself belongs to the Statement
          in witch is indented, in other words it defines a sort of hierarchy to define witch line
          of code belongs to which construct and should be executed within it</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Loops">
        <header>Loops</header>
        <article class="article">
          <p>As the name suggests Loops are special constructs provided by Python for repeating
          a certain  action in a special condition.
          The main two loops of the python programming language are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>While Loop</li>
            <li>For Loop</li>
          </ul>

          <p>the <b>While Loop</b> is used to repeat an instruction unless a
          certain condition is met, the condition itself is expressed after the While
          keyword, the instruction or instructions to repeat are expressed
          after the semicoloumn whith the correct indentation.
          Let's make an example:</p>

          <code>a = 0<br>
          b = 5<br>
          while a < b:<br>
          <p class="indent">print(a)</p>
          <p class="indent">a += 1</p></code>

          <p>The code itself is almost self explainatory, we declaired two
          variables: one is our a variable and the other is our b variable,
          entering the loop, the program checks is a is less than b, and if the
          Condition is met, it prints the value of a and increments it
          (a *= 1 is the shorthand for a = a + 1) these two instructions are
          repeted 5 times aka unless the value of a is less than the value of b</p>

          <code>Output_1 0<br>
          Output_2 1<br>
          Output_3 2<br>
          Output_4 3<br>
          Output_5 4</code>

          <p>Just like yhe While loop, the <b>For Loop</b> is also used to repeating
          actions subdued to a condition whith the difference that it can be used
          to repeat in a certain <b>range</b> of times and the word is not
          higlighted casually, infact, the for construct is often used whith the
          <b>range()</b> function.
          let's write some code to be clear:</p>

          <code>a = 0<br>
          for a in range(0,5,1)<br>
          <p class="indent">print(a)</p></code>

          <p>Ok now that wer have our piece of code to analyze, we can see in
            first place that we haven't used the instruction a += 1, this is because
            the for loop automatically increments the variable provided in it's call.
            But how he knows the way to increment the variable and where to stop
            and begin?
            All those data are provided by the range() function, the first argumrnt
            in the parenthesis is the beginning of the interval, the second is the end
            and the third is the increment.
            So for a verbose lectur of the code we can say that in the loop we print
            the value of a 0 to 5 times and each time we increment a by 1.
            <i>Note that the beginning and ending of the interval are independent from
            the value of a and indicates <b>only the number of time to repeat the cicle</b></i></p>
